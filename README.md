# python-api-challenge

This is my Python api challenge which consists of: 

Part 1:WeatherPy-demonstrating the relationship between latitude and different weather variables(Temperature, Humidity,
CLoudiness, Windspeed) and the linear regression to go along with each relationship seperated by Northern and Southern Hemisphere.

Part 2:VacationPy-planning a future vacation, firstly, creating a map to display every city, then narrowing it down to my ideal weather condition, 
and finally, finding the first hotel within the first hotel of the coordinates of the city.
